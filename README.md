# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects in **Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Business Intelligence (Power BI)**.  
Each project is designed to extract insights and generate **business value from data** through analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization.

## ÔøΩ Project Creation Script

To quickly scaffold a new data science project with a recommended folder structure and starter files, use the `create_project.py` script included in this repository.

**Usage:**

```bash
python create_project.py <project_name>
```

This will create a new folder named `<project_name>` with subfolders for data, notebooks, source code, and reports, as well as a template `README.md` and `requirements.txt` inside the new project folder.

**Example:**

```bash
python create_project.py customer-segmentation
```

This helps maintain consistency and saves time when starting new projects.
