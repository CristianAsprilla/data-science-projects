# Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the detection of fraudulent transactions using real-world financial data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can help fintech companies identify potentially fraudulent activity and reduce financial risk. This is an initial attempt and serves as a baseline for future improvements.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranjitmandal/fraud-detection-dataset-csv/data)
- **Size/Features:** 51,000+ transactions, with features on transaction details, user behavior, device, and location
- **Notes:** Highly imbalanced (few frauds vs. many legitimate transactions)

## ⚙️ Methods
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Data cleaning and user-level imputation for missing values
- Feature engineering (e.g., transaction hour, account age, device type)
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost
- Evaluation: Classification report, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall curve, Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results
- The initial XGBoost model was able to identify some fraudulent transactions, but performance is limited by the available data and class imbalance.
- Precision and recall for the fraud class are not optimal—this is a first attempt and the model is not production-ready.
- Feature importance analysis highlights which variables are most useful for fraud detection.
- Visualizations include ROC and Precision-Recall curves, and feature importance plots.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Collect more data and/or engineer additional features to improve model performance
- Experiment with advanced models and hyperparameter tuning
- Explore anomaly detection and ensemble methods
- Deploy a more robust version of the Streamlit demo app
- Address real-world challenges such as concept drift and adversarial attacks

**Note:** The current model is a baseline and not perfect. More data, feature engineering, and experimentation are needed to achieve better fraud detection results.
